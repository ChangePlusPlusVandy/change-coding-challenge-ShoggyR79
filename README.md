This program runs using the library of Tweepy and API of Twitter. 

FILES:

- game.py - the game file that fulfills most, if not all, the basic requirements of the challenge.

- game_advance.py - game file that builds upon the first one, but have user enter their own twitter ID instead of Kanye and Elon.

- README.md - this file.

- PATCHNOTE.md - shows progression of the challenge.


TODO/SETUP:

- Install tweepy (using pip install) on machine.

- Update "config.py" file with personal API information and Access token from twitter.

- OPTIONAL - find the twitter ID of two user (if running/testing game_advanced.py).




**Note**: 
- The game files assume that the number of tweets of the users exceeds the number of questions that will be asked
- Number of Generated Tweets can be changed by editting ```number_fetched_tweets``` value.
